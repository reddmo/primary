This is my website built using [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/tree/main). 

I've made modifications to suit my needs regarding the color setup. I left some of the original information below, but be sure to check out the original and the blog linked below.

## Credits and Thank yous

**Andy Bell**

His CSS methodology "CUBE" makes sense to me. It goes hand in hand with _Every Layout_ (which he co-authors). He has recently published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology. Also, I learned how to use Eleventy in 2020 with his (now free) course.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

I love order and structure. Aleksandr does this in an exemplary way, which is why I based the structure of eleventy.js on his personal site. The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from his blog.
