I'm just a guy on a webpage talking about politics and tech, sometimes mixing in finance, and sometimes all of these in the same posts. 

I just hope to have a little fun, inject some insights of mine on different topics, and hopefully engage in some dialogue.

I live in PA with my wife, our two cats, and a bearded dragon. 

One final note: Occasionally yuu'll see dumb art.
