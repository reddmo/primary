## I've redesigned the site.

It's built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and uses the (excellent) [Eleventy Excellent 2.0](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) starter. Additionally, some of the great icons you see are from [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com) and [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/).

I'm really pleased with the ease of use of both. I'm able to update this site and add elements quickly and, generally speaking, easily. I expect to do some more redesigning here but was focused on the initial setup and migrating the old design from the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), which is also a very good starter.
